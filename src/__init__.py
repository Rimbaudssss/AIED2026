"""Dynamic SCM × sequence generation with causal regularizers.

This package provides a minimal, research-friendly scaffold for:
- A dynamic SCM generator with rollout + do-intervention API
- TimeGAN-style stepwise supervision (latent dynamics consistency)
- Sequence discriminator (WGAN-GP)
- Causal regularizers (interventional alignment, deconfounded history repr.)
